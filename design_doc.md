# Memory Client Design Document

## Architecture

The memory-client-go project follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Client Layer**: Handles communication with the Qdrant vector database
2. **Models**: Defines data structures used throughout the application
3. **Dashboard**: Provides visualization of memory statistics
4. **CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the memory client

## Data Flow

1. User adds messages or project files via CLI or API
2. Data is vectorized and stored in Qdrant
3. Metadata is attached to vectors for efficient retrieval
4. Dashboard visualizes the memory statistics in real-time

## Technical Decisions

- Using Go for performance and concurrency
- Qdrant for vector storage and similarity search
- JSON for configuration and data interchange
- Chart.js for dashboard visualizations
